# zeureka

A custom Linux distribution made by Zed and Eureka_knight for learning the inner-workings of Linux Distribution and its derivatives

We would be following the Linux From Scratch book as our main guide with various supplements if needed

Hopefully we will have a basic linux distribution that works (at least in a terminal).
